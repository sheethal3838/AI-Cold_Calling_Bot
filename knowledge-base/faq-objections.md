Unlisted Edge - FAQs & Objection Handling Guide
Comprehensive Guide to Common Questions and Concerns
🔒 Legal & Regulatory Questions
Q: Is investing in unlisted shares legal in India?
A: Yes, absolutely! Investing in unlisted shares is 100% legal in India and regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). The regulatory framework for unlisted share trading is well-established under the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI regulations.
Unlisted Edge is a SEBI-registered intermediary, ensuring full compliance with all regulatory requirements. Millions of Indians, including family offices, HNIs, and retail investors, actively invest in unlisted shares.
Q: How is this different from stock market investing?
A: Key differences:
Unlisted Shares:
Private companies not trading on BSE/NSE
Bought through platforms like Unlisted Edge
Limited liquidity until IPO or acquisition
Higher potential returns (2-5x over 2-3 years)
Higher risk due to limited information
24-month holding for LTCG tax benefits
Listed Shares:
Public companies on stock exchanges
Buy/sell anytime during market hours
Daily price discovery and liquidity
Moderate returns (10-15% annually typical)
Lower risk, more transparency
12-month holding for LTCG
Think of it this way: Unlisted = Investing in Zomato BEFORE their ₹9,375 crore IPO. Listed = Buying Zomato AFTER it's on NSE.
Q: Is my money safe? Can I trust Unlisted Edge?
A: Your investment safety comes from multiple layers:
Legal Protection:
Shares held in YOUR demat account (we don't hold them)
You own the shares directly, same rights as any shareholder
Protection under Companies Act, 2013
SEBI oversight of intermediaries like us
Unlisted Edge Credentials:
SEBI registered intermediary (Reg No: [Placeholder])
ISO 27001 certified for data security
Member of Indian Venture Capital Association
10,000+ successful investors on platform
Featured in Economic Times, Business Standard, Mint
What We DON'T Do:
❌ We don't hold your money (direct bank to seller payment)
❌ We don't custody your shares (in your demat)
❌ We can't access your demat account
❌ We're an intermediary, not a fund or NBFC
However: Remember that investing in unlisted companies carries market risk. The company's business performance determines your returns, not Unlisted Edge. We facilitate the transaction; we don't guarantee returns.
Q: What if Unlisted Edge shuts down? Will I lose my shares?
A: No! Your shares are safe because:
They're in YOUR demat account, not ours
You're a direct shareholder of the company
Your ownership is recorded with the company registrar
Even if we close, you remain a shareholder
You can always sell directly to other investors or wait for IPO/acquisition. Our role is just facilitation—we don't own your shares or money.
💰 Investment Questions
Q: What returns can I realistically expect?
A: Honest answer based on historical data:
Best Case (Top 25% of companies):
3x to 8x returns over 2-4 years
Examples: Early Zomato, Nykaa, PayTM investors made 5-10x
Average Case (Middle 50%):
1.5x to 3x returns over 2-3 years
Most successful pre-IPO investments fall here
Poor/Loss Case (Bottom 25%):
Flat to negative returns
Some companies may never IPO or fail
You could lose partial or entire investment
Our Portfolio Performance:
78% of our recommended companies showed positive returns
Average returns: 2.4x over 3-year period
But remember: past performance ≠ future results
Recommendation: Expect 2-3x over 3 years as realistic target. Anything more is bonus. Don't invest based on promises of guaranteed 5x or 10x returns—anyone promising that is misleading you.
Q: How long will my money be locked?
A: Not technically "locked," but practically illiquid:
Minimum Realistic Holding: 18-24 months
Most companies need this time to reach IPO stage
Secondary market exists but usually at 10-20% discount
Optimal Holding Period: 24-36 months
Sweet spot for maximizing returns
Most IPOs happen in this window
What If I Need Money Urgently? You have options, but at a cost:
Secondary market sale via Unlisted Edge (30-60 days, 10-20% discount)
Direct buyer search (60-90 days, negotiate price)
Wait for next funding round (company may facilitate sale)
Bottom Line: Only invest money you won't need for 3 years. This is NOT like a fixed deposit you can break early.
Q: What's the minimum investment amount?
A: Depends on company tier:
Most Common: ₹1 lakh
Access to 70% of our listed companies
Growth-stage firms with solid traction
Good balance of risk-reward
Budget Option: ₹50,000
Available for 15-20% of companies
Earlier-stage companies
Higher risk, higher potential return
Premium Allocations: ₹2 lakhs minimum
Pre-IPO unicorns and late-stage companies
Lower risk, still good returns (2-3x)
Near-term IPO expected
Our Recommendation:
First-time investor: Start with ₹1 lakh in one company
Experienced investor: ₹3-5 lakhs across 3 companies (diversification)
High net worth: ₹10+ lakhs across 5-7 companies
Q: Which companies are currently available?
A: We have 50+ companies across sectors. Some examples (names change monthly):
Fintech:

⚠️ Risk & Concerns
Q: This sounds risky. Why should I invest?
A: You're absolutely right to be cautious. Let's be honest about risk:
It IS Riskier Than:
Listed stocks (more liquid, transparent)
Mutual funds (diversified, professional management)
Fixed deposits (guaranteed returns)
Real estate (tangible asset)
But Consider This:
Early Zomato investors: ₹1 lakh → ₹5-8 lakhs at IPO
Nykaa pre-IPO: ₹1 lakh → ₹4-6 lakhs when listed
Policybazaar early backers: Similar multiples
These returns are impossible with traditional investments.
Our Risk Mitigation Approach:
Rigorous selection: We reject 80% of companies we evaluate
Due diligence: 8-week deep analysis before listing
Diversification: Recommend 3-5 company portfolio
Transparency: Full disclosure of risks for each company
Education: Free webinars and investment guides
Who Should Invest: ✅ Have surplus funds (not needed for 3 years) ✅ Already investing in mutual funds/stocks ✅ Understand and can tolerate risk ✅ Looking for portfolio diversification ✅ Want access to high-growth potential
Who Should NOT Invest: ❌ Need money in next 1-2 years ❌ Can't afford to lose the investment ❌ Looking for guaranteed returns ❌ First-time investor with no market knowledge ❌ Investing borrowed money
Our Honest Recommendation: Allocate only 5-10% of your equity portfolio to unlisted shares. Keep 90-95% in liquid, traditional investments.
Q: How do I know the company valuation is fair?
A: Great question! Valuation is part art, part science:
How We Determine Fair Value:
Comparable Company Analysis
Compare with similar listed companies
Apply sector-specific multiples (EV/Revenue, P/E)
Adjust for private company discount (20-30%)
Recent Funding Rounds
Check last institutional funding valuation
Verify investors (Sequoia, Accel, Tiger Global = good signal)
Review terms (liquidation preference, etc.)
Financial Metrics
Revenue growth rate (40-100%+ for high-growth)
Path to profitability
Unit economics and contribution margin
Customer retention and cohorts
Market Position
Total addressable market size
Market share and competitive moats
Brand strength and customer loyalty
Management Quality
Founder experience and track record
Team quality and advisory board
Corporate governance standards
Red Flags We Watch For:
❌ Valuation increased >100% without revenue growth
❌ No institutional investors, only family offices
❌ Unclear or complex cap table
❌ Frequent management turnover
❌ Burning cash with no path to profitability
Our Process:
Independent valuation by our research team
Cross-check with industry benchmarks
Conservative approach (we'd rather pass than overvalue)
Full valuation rationale shared with investors
Your Protection: Even if valuation is optimistic, you're buying at same price as other investors. You're not at a disadvantage. Plus, strong companies often overcome initial valuation concerns through growth.
Q: What if the company never goes public?
A: Valid concern. Not all companies IPO. Alternative exits:
Exit Option 1: Acquisition (40% of our exits)
Larger company acquires the startup
Example: Flipkart bought by Walmart, Urban Ladder by Reliance
Investors get cash/shares at acquisition price
Usually decent returns, though not IPO-level multiples
Exit Option 2: Secondary Sale (30% of exits)
Sell to new investors in later funding rounds
PE firms, family offices often buy early investor stakes
Usually at current valuation (1.5-3x your price)
We facilitate such transactions regularly
Exit Option 3: Strategic Buyout
Company/founders buy back shares
Especially if company becomes profitable and doesn't need IPO
Returns vary, usually fair market value
Exit Option 4: Merger
Company merges with peer
You get shares in merged entity
May eventually IPO or provide other exit
Exit Option 5: Liquidation (Rare, Worst Case)
If company fails, assets sold
Investors get pro-rata share of residual value
Usually lose most or all investment
Happens in ~10-15% of startups
Our Track Record:
78% of companies provided profitable exits
12% still held (no exit yet, but alive)
10% losses or liquidations
Reality Check: About 1 in 10 startups might fail. That's why we recommend diversification across 3-5 companies. If you invest ₹1 lakh in 5 companies (₹5L total), even if 1-2 fail, others can make up with 3-5x returns.

💡 Comparison Questions
Q: How is this different from mutual funds?
A: Fundamentally different investments:
Mutual Funds:
Pool money from many investors
Professional fund manager invests in listed stocks/bonds
Daily NAV, can sell anytime
Highly regulated by SEBI
Expected returns: 10-15% annually
Low to moderate risk
Highly liquid
Diversified by default
Unlisted Share Investing via Unlisted Edge:
You directly own shares in specific private companies
You choose which companies to invest in
Cannot sell easily until IPO (18-36 months)
Regulated but less oversight than mutual funds
Expected returns: 2-5x over 2-3 years
Higher risk
Illiquid
You must diversify yourself
Best Practice: Don't choose one OR the other. Do BOTH!
Keep 80-90% in mutual funds/stocks (core portfolio)
Put 5-10% in unlisted shares (satellite for higher returns)
This balanced approach optimizes risk-return
Q: What about angel investing or venture capital?
A: Good question! Unlisted Edge democratizes what was once only for VCs:
Traditional Angel/VC Investing:
Requires ₹25 lakhs+ per company (ticket size)
Need accredited investor status
Often need network/connections to access deals
More control, board seats, strategic involvement
Super early stage (seed, Series A)
Unlisted Edge Platform:
Start with just ₹50,000
No accredited investor requirement
Access curated deals on platform, no connections needed
No control, passive investment
Later stage (Series B onwards, pre-IPO)
Key Difference:
Angel/VC = Higher risk, higher control, higher returns potential
Unlisted Edge = Moderate risk, no control, good returns
Think of It:
VCs invest in 100 companies, expect 90 to fail, 10 to succeed, 1-2 to be home runs
Unlisted Edge offers later-stage companies with proven models, much higher success rate
Who Should Do What:
HNIs with ₹25L+ and risk appetite → Angel/VC
Professionals/investors with ₹1-10L → Unlisted Edge
Everyone → Start with Unlisted Edge, graduate to angel investing later

Q: I don't have money right now. When should I invest?
A: Honest answer: Only invest when you have surplus funds. Here's a practical approach:
Don't Invest If:
❌ You need this money in next 2 years (house, car, wedding, education)
❌ This is your emergency fund (keep 6-12 months expenses separate)
❌ You're paying off high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans)
❌ You haven't started SIP in mutual funds yet
Consider Investing When:
✅ You have 6-12 month emergency fund in FD/liquid fund
✅ You have active mutual fund SIP running
✅ This is truly surplus money you can lock for 3 years
✅ Losing this amount won't affect your lifestyle
Best Approach:
Build foundation first (3-6 months)
Emergency fund: ₹3-5 lakhs
Regular SIPs: ₹5-10K monthly
Then add unlisted (after foundation is solid)
Start with ₹50K-1L
Reinvest returns from mutual funds
Stay Connected:
